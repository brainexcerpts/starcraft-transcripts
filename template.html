    <h1>Starcraft</h1>   

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class='transcriptText no-header green-terminal'>
        <p>
            Welcome to this English and Japanese transcript of the "StarCraft® 1998" campaign
            (property of Blizzard Entertainment®). 
            This work won't include "StarCraft®: Brood War®" transcript, since it was not localized to Japan 
            and I'm using the original version (as opposed to the remaster).
        </p>

        <p>
            When I started to learn Japanese I tried to look for content I used to enjoy in my teenage years.
            This transcript is what I whish I had found at that time.
            I believe language learning is much more efficient with content you like and so
            I hope this will help my fellow "Starcraft loving <a
                href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Weeb">weebs</a>" out there :p
        </p>

        <p>
            This will only cover the Terran campaign, if I ever find the time and energy
            Protoss and Zerg campaign are left to do. 
            I did write down their raw transcripts but it stills needs proper html formatting and be matched with 
            the english transcript as well as adding furigana and kanji explanations...            
            Only the Japanese voice over is present.
            Keep in mind these are <u>transcripts</u> from the game, and not a literal translation.
            It is likely that Blizzard derived the Japanese from the English version 
            with the goal to preserve intent, not accuracy.  
            So this won't be a 1 to 1 mapping. 
            
            
            If you want to contribute (add campaigns, fix typos, add voice over or a language etc.),
            here is the 
            <a href="https://github.com/brainexcerpts/starcraft-transcripts">git repository</a>.

    <h2>The journey</h2>
    <div class='transcriptText no-header green-terminal'>
        <p>
            God it took me quite some time to publish that project, I had that idea back in 2015
            and bought the Japanese version of Starcraft in some game shop in Tokyo Akihabara.
            I started to play the game and quickly realized that the Japanese dialogues in it
            were just out of my league. As I was playing the game I suddenly wished 
            I had the English transcript alongside...
            I also wanted to quickly find out the kanjis' pronunciation
            in realtime by hovering my mouse, just like I would do in my browser with
            <a href="https://alternativeto.net/software/rikaichan/">rikaichan extension</a>.
            So the journey began, and it took me so long to extract the dialogues and then format it 
            properly with a somewhat decent css theme and Javascript to process everything. 
            I would take lengthy breaks or give up for months or years... But here it is!

            I'm invoking <a href="https://www.lib.purdue.edu/uco/fair-use">the fair use exception</a> for this work.<br>            
            <br>
            
            1: Purpose and character: it is a non-profit educational project.<br>
            2: Nature of the Work: it is a factual work (as opposed to fictional) 
            This provides the tools to analyze the story, in addition to extra commentaries to explain the Japanese.<br>
            3: Amount: the original work is a game which main purpose is online RTS battles and contests.
            My estimation is that a partial transcript of its background story that is a mere support to the atmosphere 
            and unrelated to its main mechanics can be considered fairly small.<br>
            4: Market Effect: is near null since the original game is not sold anymore.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            That being said I highly encourage you retribute the source material 
            by <a href="https://starcraft.com">buying the remastered version of the game</a>
            which is an awesome piece of history in addition to be a top notch game.
            I personally own many of Blizzard's games including StarCraft®, StarCraft®: Brood War® and their
            remastered version.
            Although this endeavor took an enormous amount of time, 
            since the source material is not my property and this is a non-profit project,
            do not attempt to donate to me or reward me in any financial way for this work in particular.
