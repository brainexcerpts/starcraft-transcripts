<h2>PROLOGUE</h2>

<div class='transcriptText'>
   <div class='english'>
      The Zerg Overmind has succeeded in invading
      the Protoss Homeworld of Aiur and has embedded itself into the crust of the planet.

      Now, as the agents of the sinister Overmind  spread chaos and destruction across the  face of Aiur,
      the stalwart Protoss defenders prepare themselves for the coming onslaught.

      En Taro Adun, Executor.
      I am Judicator Aldaris, and I have been sent by the Conclave to serve and counsel you.
      The former Executor, Tassadar, was commanded to halt the Zerg progress in the Terran
      sector by burning the infested human worlds.

      Unfortunately, he disregarded his orders and attempted to destroy
      the Zerg while sparing the Terrans from the flame. Clearly, Tassadar has failed us.
      You must not.

      The Conclave has dictated that our first priority is to strengthen our defenses.
      You must reinforce our outpost in Antioch and make certain that the province does not fall to the Zerg.
      Your old comrade, Praetor Fenix, will meet you there an assist you in this endeavor.

      Be silent, Judicator. There is no time to waste, and I have much to tell you.
      As you know, the Zerg vanished after the fall of the Terran world of Tarsonis,
      and though the Conclave bid me return home, I was compelled to remain.

      A powerful psionic call drew my attention to a remote, barren world named Char.
      Apparently, the call was answered by others as well.
      For upon Char, I encountered those who were once our brethren - the Dark Templar.

      The Zerg Hive cluster near the Scion province was destroyed,

      Praetor Fenix, hero and Steward of the Templar, was killed during the assault.
      The Conclave, convinced that its stratagems are winning the war against the Zerg,
      have let down their guard and turn their attention to personal matters.
      The Judicator Aldaris was ordered to find and arrest the wayward Tassadar
      and bring him home to stand trial for his crimes of treason.

      Now, with only a small fleet for protection,
      Aldaris and the Executor have traveled to the ash world of Char,
      hoping that Tassadar is still somewhere to be found.

      But remember that he lived and died as a Templar.
      He has reached the Khala's end.
      There is no greater glory than that.

      We Judicator are called to look beyond such matters;
      to ensure the safety and future of our people.
      It is not the Zerg, but the rogue Tassadar,
      who represents the greatest threat to us now.

      If he is allowed to spread the Dark Templar's tainted influence to Aiur,
      all will be lost.
      We will find him and bring him to judgement.

      Tassadar claimed that this world was abandoned by the Zerg just prior to the invasion of Aiur.

      Executor, our plan worked perfectly.
      The Zerg defenses are broken,
      and the way to the Overmind is laid bare!
      The time for our stand has come.

      Indeed. My friends, this is our final hour.
      Not all of us may survive the coming conflict.
      Yet, death may be a blessing should we fail here.
      We seek now to destroy a foe that has ravaged its way across the universe
      consuming all in its path.

      And now it has reached the end of its long journey.
      The Overmind has come to destroy all that we hold dear and assimilate us into itself.
      And I say to thee, this shall not come to pass! Aiur shall not fall!
      Executor, I stand ready!

      Well, I guess all I have left is to see this through.
      The Zerg have taken everything from me: my home, my family, my friends.
      I know that nothing I do can bring those things back,
      but I'll be damned if I just sit on my hands and wait for the end.
      I want a piece of 'em, all right. I'm in.

      Executor. Tassadar.
      This comes too late to you.
      But the Conclave has witnessed your defeat of the  Cerebrate.
      They know now that they cannot deny the necessity or the valiancy of your actions.
      We sought to punish you, while it was we who were in error.
      You represent the greatest in us all, and all our hopes go with you.
      EN TARO ADUN, brave Sons of Aiur!

<h2>Successfully destroy the Overmind (only its outer shell though...)</h2>

<div class='transcriptText'>
   <narrator>Tassadar</narrator>
   <div class='english'>
      Executor, the Overmind has been weakened,
      but I fear we have sustained severe damage ourselves.
      I will steer the Gantrithor into a collision course with the Overmind.
      If I can channel enough of the Dark Templars' energy through the hull of the Gantrithor,
      I should be able to bring swift death to the accursed abomination.
      Remember us, Executor.
      Remember what was done here today.
      May Adun watch over you.

<h1>Epilogue</h1>

<div class='transcriptText'>
   <div class='english'>
      As the chaotic, swirling energies subsided,
      a heavy silence settled over the battlefields of Aiur.
      Due to Tassadar's noble sacrifice,
      the Overmind was now dead and the Zerg Swarms were scattered and broken.
      But as the heroes surveyed their once glorious homeland,
      they realized that their victory had cost them all but their lives.
      Aiur was left nothing more than a smoldering ruin.
      Those few Protoss who survived the final battle could only wonder what the future would hold for their race.

      And far away, on the distant planet Char, Kerrigan, the self-styled Queen of Blades,
      knew that the time of her ascension was at hand.
