TODO list.

Priority:
---------

- Final check for the english transcript against walkthrough video.
(Japanese is already checked)
- Finish Protoss and Zerg campain
(we need to insert audio tags, match english in htmlr to japanese in /raw_campaign, detail the japanese)
(see Terran campaign for a template)
- Finish adding english audio in /en folders.

Secondary:
----------

- Add links to cinematic and more screenshots.
- Add links to background music.

Tertiary:
----------

- fix github page https://brainexcerpts.github.io/starcraft-transcripts/template.html
  (paths are broken, in the particular case of a github page https://brainexcerpts.github.io/ is treated as root
   although it should be https://brainexcerpts.github.io/starcraft-transcripts/, so set a variable to represent the root path,
  and detect when we are using github page to set it properly).
- Starcraft manual EN/JP transcript (especially the history of Terran/Zerg/Protoss)
- Transcript for the BroodWar campaign as well.
(based on remastered version since there is no Japanese for the original 1998)
- click sound (original starcraft) when clicking language flags
- Global menu to switch language for everything. (see toggleJapanese())
- floating table of content to jump to a specific mission or campaing.
- javascript to generate raw text files: only japanese .txt, only english .txt, side by side .txt.
- Table of content and separate the campaign into several chapters.
- Add the narrator "gif portraits" alongside names.
- to make play icons disappear when the current language audio file is not present.
- side by side mode where english is displayed alongside with japanese
(as opposed to switching language via clicking the language flags)
- text reveal effect as we scroll down?
